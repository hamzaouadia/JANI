> **Farm operations and field activity management**



The Operations Service manages day-to-day farm operations, field management, and agricultural activities tracking for the JANI platform.> **Farm operations and activities management**Operations is a lightweight Express + Mongoose microservice that keeps farms, fields, and field activities in sync across JANI. It exposes CRUD endpoints and helper workflows that the mobile and web apps call to manage day-to-day agronomy operations.



## üìã Overview



- **Type**: TypeScript Express ServiceThe Operations Service handles day-to-day farm operations, activity logging, and resource tracking.## Capabilities

- **Port**: 5003 (default)

- **Database**: MongoDB

- **Package Manager**: pnpm

- **Security**: Helmet, CORS## üìã Overview- REST API for farms, fields, and activity planning, including validation via Zod.



## üéØ Core Responsibilities- Geo-aware storage for field boundaries (Polygon/MultiPolygon) with MongoDB indexes.



1. **Farm Operations** - Manage farm-level operations and metadata- **Type**: TypeScript Express Service- Farm linkage workflow that toggles `linked` status and tracks follow-up actions.

2. **Field Management** - Track individual fields/plots within farms

3. **Activity Tracking** - Log planting, irrigation, fertilization, harvesting- **Port**: 5003 (default)- Demo data and migration scripts to quickly bootstrap a local database.

4. **Resource Management** - Monitor water, fertilizer, pesticide usage

5. **Operational Analytics** - Track farm productivity and efficiency- **Database**: MongoDB- All HTTP endpoints are mounted under `/api/*` (e.g. `/api/farms`); existing clients keep working without additional proxies.



## üöÄ Quick Start- **Package Manager**: pnpm



```bash## Service Layout

cd services/operations

pnpm install## üéØ Responsibilities

pnpm run dev

``````



### Environment Variables1. **Activity Management**src/

2. **Operation Types**  routes/            # Express routers mounted under /farms, /fields, /activities

### Base URL

```   - Planting activities  scripts/           # Seed + migration helpers for local workflows

### Health Check   - Fertilization records```

```http

GET /health   - Pest management

```

   - Harvest operations## Environment

**Response:**

```json

{

  "status": "ok",3. **Resource Tracking**| Variable | Purpose | Default |

  "service": "JANI Operations Service",

  "uptime": 3600.5   - Water usage| --- | --- | --- |

}

```   - Fertilizer consumption| `SERVICE_NAME` | Label returned by `/health` and logs | `operations-service` |



### Farm Routes (`/api/farms`)   - Pesticide application| `PORT` | HTTP port used by the Express server | `4003` |



#### List Farms   - Labor hours| `MONGO_URI` | MongoDB connection string | `mongodb://mongo:27017/jani-operations` |

```http

GET /api/farms?page=1&limit=20

```

## üöÄ Quick StartLoad these from the root `.env` or export them before starting the service.

#### Create Farm

```http

POST /api/farms

Content-Type: application/json```bash## Getting Started



{cd services/operations

  "name": "Sunrise Farm",

  "location": {pnpm install```bash

    "address": "456 Country Road",

    "coordinates": [-122.0, 37.5]pnpm run devcd services/operations

  },

  "totalArea": 50,```pnpm install

  "areaUnit": "hectares"

}pnpm dev

```

### Environment Variables```

#### Get Farm

```http

GET /api/farms/:id

``````bashThe dev script uses `ts-node` and watches the TypeScript sources. Use `pnpm build && pnpm start` when you need the compiled `dist/` output.



#### Update FarmMONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/jani_operations

```http

PUT /api/farms/:idPORT=5003A basic health probe is available at `GET /health`.

Content-Type: application/json

```

{

  "name": "Sunrise Organic Farm",## Data Workflows

  "certifications": ["organic"]

}## üì° API Reference

```

- `pnpm seed` ‚Äì Populates demo farms, fields, and activities. The script is idempotent and safe to rerun.

#### Delete Farm

```http### Base URL- `pnpm migrate:auth-data` ‚Äì Pulls authoritative farm data from the auth service (run after both services are online).

DELETE /api/farms/:id

``````



#### Get Farm Statisticshttp://localhost:5003MongoDB indexes are defined directly on the Mongoose schemas; no separate migration step is required.

```http

GET /api/farms/:id/statistics```

```
