# AI Service# AI Service



> **Machine learning and AI integrations (placeholder)**The AI service is a minimal Express placeholder that keeps an endpoint available while the platformâ€™s machine-learning features are being designed. It exposes a single health route and is wired for JSON payloads so future endpoints can land without extra setup.



The AI Service is a placeholder for future ML/AI features including crop recommendations, yield predictions, and image recognition.## Capabilities



## ðŸ“‹ Overview- `/health` returns service metadata, uptime, and a note explaining that the implementation is a stub.

- JSON body parsing is already enabled for incoming requests.

- **Type**: JavaScript Express Service- Port selection happens through `PORT`, making the service deployable both locally and inside Docker Compose.

- **Port**: 5001 (default)

- **Package Manager**: npm## Project Layout

- **Status**: Placeholder / Development

```

## ðŸŽ¯ Planned Featuresserver.js        # Express bootstrap and health endpoint

.env.example     # Sample environment configuration

1. **Crop Recommendations**Dockerfile       # Minimal container build

   - ML-based crop suggestionspackage.json     # Scripts and dependencies (Express only)

   - Soil analysis```

   - Climate data integration

## Environment

2. **Yield Prediction**

   - Historical data analysis| Variable | Purpose | Default |

   - Weather correlation| --- | --- | --- |

   - Production forecasting| `PORT` | HTTP port exposed by the service | `5001` |

| `NODE_ENV` | Future toggle for logging or feature flags | `development` |

3. **Image Recognition**| `AI_SERVICE_URL` | Optional URL other services can reference | `http://localhost:4003` |

   - Pest detection| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | Placeholder credential for upcoming integrations | _(unset)_ |

   - Disease identification

   - Crop health assessmentCopy `.env.example` to `.env` (or export equivalent variables) before running locally.



4. **Market Intelligence**## Local Development

   - Price forecasting

   - Demand prediction```bash

   - Market trendscd services/ai

pnpm install

## ðŸš€ Quick Startpnpm start

```

```bash

cd services/aiOn startup you should see `AI service listening on <port>` in the terminal.

npm install

npm start### Verify

```

```bash

### Environment Variablescurl http://localhost:5001/health

```

```bash

}

### Current Endpoints```



```http## Docker

GET  /health              # Health check

POST /api/analyze         # Placeholder for AI analysis```bash

```cd services/ai

docker build -t jani-ai-service .

### Example Requestdocker run --rm -p 5001:5001 jani-ai-service

```

```http

GET /healthDocker Compose users can rely on the `ai` service declared at the repository root; it maps the port based on `.env` just like local runs.

```

## Next Steps

**Response:**

```json- Add authentication once real AI endpoints are available.

{- Introduce structured logging and metrics before exposing inference workloads.

  "status": "healthy",- Replace the placeholder health note with real capability information when integrations land.

  "service": "ai",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "message": "AI service placeholder - ready for integration"
}
```

## ðŸ”® Future Integration

This service is designed to integrate with:
- OpenAI GPT models
- TensorFlow.js
- Computer vision APIs
- Weather APIs
- Market data providers

## ðŸš€ Deployment

```bash
docker build -t jani-ai .
docker run -p 5001:5001 jani-ai
```
